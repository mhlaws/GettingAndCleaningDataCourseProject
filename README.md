# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The data for this project came from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

It is comprised of
 - test subjects
 - activity types
 - sensor data

For the purposes of this course, we only care about sensor data that is either a mean or standard deviation and we want to see all three data categories combined into a single table where each column is a variable and each row is an observation.
